# Matrix Multiplication Using Textures

This example shows several matrix multiplication benchmarks using textures with WebGL 2.0 Compute.

matmul_cs_texture_r32f.htm was ported from [this](http://ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/gpu/mul/mul32b.htm).
matmul_cs_texture_rgba32f.htm used similar method with tfjs-core's batchMatMul.

Matrix multiplication using buffers can refer to [this](http://ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/gpu/mul/sgemm.htm) by Evgeny Demidov.
